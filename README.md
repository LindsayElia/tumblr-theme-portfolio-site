## Custom Tumblr Theme
This is a custom tumblr theme to match the styling of my portfolio site at [www.lindsayelia.com](http://lindsayelia.com/index). You can view a live version of the theme at [blog.lindsayelia.com](http://blog.lindsayelia.com/).

If you are looking to create your own custom Tumblr theme, check out the Tumblr documentation on [Creating a Custom HTML Theme](https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes).

### Please note that this theme is incomplete.

- It does not contain complete markup for each type of post.
- It does not contain markup for pages that are not the main post page.

### How to install this theme:

- Login to your Tumblr account
- Go to the dashboard for the Tumblr (blog) that you want to update
- Choose `Edit appearance` from the Tumblr menu in the upper right
- Click the button to `Edit theme` next to `Website Theme`
- Click the link to `Edit HTML` under `Custom theme`
- Select everything in the black text editing area on the left side of the page and delete it.
- Open the file from this repository called `theme.html` and select everything. Copy the contents of the `theme.html` file and paste into the editing area on tumblr.
- Click the button to `Update Preview` near the top of the page. You can view what your blog's main page will look with this new custom theme on the right side of the page.
- If you like what you see, click the `Save` button near the top of the page (this button only appears after you update the preview).
- If you don't like what you see, continue to make edits to the theme. 
- To undo all changes, before saving, click the `Tumblr back arrow` (in the top left of the page, not the back button on your browser) to go back to the previous page. Confirm that you want to close without saving and/or exit without saving.
- To preserve your original theme (before making any edits) copy and save the contents of the editing area to a file using a plain text editor. That way you have a copy of the original to revert back to in case anything goes wrong. Tumblr also stores the [last 20 versions](https://staff.tumblr.com/post/380346543/theme-recovery) of your theme edits so you can revert your theme back to one of those.

### What is a plain text editor?
A plain text editor is an application that lets you edit text but does not add additional markup that a typical word processor application does. They come standard with most computers. On Mac the application is called **TextEdit** and on Windows the application is called **Notepad**.

There are also many applications that let you work with files in plain text and have additional features for helping you to write code easier. There is a nice short list [here](http://lifehacker.com/five-best-text-editors-1564907215) that covers some popular text editors and their features.
