## Custom Tumblr Theme
This is a custom tumblr theme to match the styling of my portfolio site at [www.lindsayelia.com](http://lindsayelia.com/index). You can view a live version of the theme at [blog.lindsayelia.com](http://blog.lindsayelia.com/).

If you are looking to create your own custom Tumblr theme, check out the Tumblr documentation on [Creating a Custom HTML Theme](https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes).

### Please note that this theme is incomplete.

- It does not contain complete markup for each type of post.
- It does not contain markup for pages that are not the main post page.

### How to install this theme:

- Login to your Tumblr account
- Go to the dashboard for the Tumblr (blog) that you want to update
- Choose `Edit appearance` from the Tumblr menu in the upper right
- Click the button to `Edit theme` next to `Website Theme`
- Click the link to `Edit HTML` under `Custom theme`
- Select everything in the black text editing area on the left side of the page and delete it.
- Open the file from this repository called theme.html and select everything. Copy the contents of the theme.html file and paste into the editing area on your tumblr blog.
- Click the button to `Update Preview` near the top of the page. Check out how your blog's main page will look with this new custom theme on the right side of the page.
- If you like what you see, click the `Save` button near the top of the page (this button only appears after you update the preview).
- If you don't like what you see, continue to make edits to the theme. To undo all changes, click the `Tumblr back arrow` (in the top left of the page, NOT the back button on your browser) to go back to the previous page. Confirm that you want to close without saving and/or exit without saving.
